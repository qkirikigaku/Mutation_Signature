<h1>COSMIC Known Signatures (M1, Known)</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These mutation signatures are COSMIC Known Signatures.</p>

<h2 id=1_Known>COSMIC Known Signature 1</h2>

<figcaption>Signature 1</figcaption></figure>
    <div><h4>Cancer types:</h4><span> Signature 1 has been found in all cancer types and in most cancer samples.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Proposed aetiology:</h4><span> Signature 1 is the result of an endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Additional mutational features:</h4><span> Signature 1 is associated with small numbers of small insertions and deletions in most tissue types.
      </span></div> <div><h4>Comments:</h4><span> The number of Signature 1 mutations correlates with age of cancer diagnosis. </span>

<h2 id=2_Known>COSMIC Known Signature 2</h2>
<figure>
<a href=M1/Known/predicted_2.png data-lightbox="enlarged"><img src=M1/Known/predicted_2.png width=400></a>
<figcaption>Signature 2</figcaption></figure>
    <div><h4>Cancer types:</h4><span> Signature 2 has been found in 22 cancer types, but most commonly in cervical and bladder cancers. In most of these 22 cancer types, Signature 2 is present in at least 10% of samples.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Proposed aetiology:</h4><span> Signature 2 has been attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases. On the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems, a role for APOBEC1, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B in human cancer appears more likely than for other members of the family.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Additional mutational features:</h4><span> Transcriptional strand bias of mutations has been observed in exons, but is not present or is weaker in introns.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Comments:</h4><span> Signature 2 is usually found in the same samples as Signature 13. It has been proposed that activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases is due to viral infection, retrotransposon jumping or to tissue inflammation. Currently, there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses. A germline deletion polymorphism involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B  is associated with the presence of large numbers of Signature 2 and 13 mutations and with predisposition to breast cancer. Mutations of similar patterns to Signatures 2 and 13 are commonly found in the phenomenon of local hypermutation present in some cancers, known as kataegis, potentially implicating AID/APOBEC enzymes in this process as well.

        </span></div> <div><h4>Comments:</h4><span> Signature 3 is strongly associated with germline and somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. In pancreatic cancer, responders to platinum therapy usually exhibit Signature 3 mutations.

        </span></div> <div><h4>Proposed aetiology:</h4><span> Signature 4 is associated with smoking and its profile is similar to the mutational pattern observed in experimental systems exposed to tobacco carcinogens (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene). Signature 4 is likely due to tobacco mutagens.
        </span></div>
        <div>
          <h4>Additional mutational features:</h4>
          <span> Signature 4 exhibits transcriptional strand bias for C&gt;A mutations, compatible with the notion that damage to guanine is repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Signature 4 is also associated with CC&gt;AA dinucleotide substitutions.

        </span></div> <div><h4>Proposed aetiology:</h4><span> Based on its prevalence in ultraviolet exposed areas and the similarity of the mutational pattern to that observed in experimental systems exposed to ultraviolet light Signature 7 is likely due to ultraviolet light exposure.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Additional mutational features:</h4><span> Signature 7 is associated with large numbers of CC&gt;TT dinucleotide mutations at dipyrimidines. Additionally, Signature 7 exhibits a strong transcriptional strand-bias indicating that mutations occur at pyrimidines (viz., by formation of pyrimidine-pyrimidine photodimers) and these mutations are being repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair.

<figcaption>Signature 13</figcaption></figure>
    <div><h4>Cancer types:</h4><span> Signature 13 has been found in 22 cancer types and seems to be commonest in cervical and bladder cancers. In most of these 22 cancer types, Signature 13 is present in at least 10% of samples.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Proposed aetiology:</h4><span> Signature 13 has been attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases converting cytosine to uracil. On the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems, a role for APOBEC1, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B  in human cancer appears more likely than for other members of the family. Signature 13 causes predominantly C&gt;G mutations. This may be due to generation of abasic sites after removal of uracil by base excision repair and replication over these abasic sites by REV1.

        </span></div> <div><h4>Proposed aetiology:</h4><span> Signature 26 is believed to be associated with defective DNA mismatch repair.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Additional mutational features:</h4><span> Signature 26 is associated with high numbers of small (shorter than 3bp) insertions and deletions at mono/polynucleotide repeats.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Comments:</h4><span> Signature 26 is one of four mutational signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and is often found in the same samples as Signatures 6, 15 and 20.

<figcaption>Signature 29</figcaption></figure>
    <div><h4>Cancer types:</h4><span> Signature 29 has been observed only in gingivo-buccal oral squamous cell carcinoma.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Proposed aetiology:</h4><span> Signature 29 has been found in cancer samples from individuals with a tobacco chewing habit.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Additional mutational features:</h4><span> Signature 29 exhibits transcriptional strand bias for C&gt;A mutations indicating guanine damage that is most likely repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Signature 29 is also associated with CC&gt;AA dinucleotide substitutions.
        </span></div> <div><h4>Comments:</h4><span> The Signature 29 pattern of C&gt;A mutations due to tobacco chewing appears different from the pattern of mutations due to tobacco smoking reflected by Signature 4.
